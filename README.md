# PGSExplorer
PGSExplorer is a bioinformatics workflow designed to calculate polygenic scores by processing genomic data through quality control steps. Optionally, it can utilize tools such as [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/), [PRSice-2](https://choishingwan.github.io/PRSice/), [LD-Pred2 (grid)](https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/LDpred2.html), [LD-Pred (auto)](https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/LDpred2.html), [PRS-CSx](https://github.com/getian107/PRScsx), and [MUSSEL](https://github.com/Jin93/MUSSEL). The workflow requires genomic files in PLINK format (.bed, .bim, .fam) and GWAS summary statistics for two different populations as input to complete the analysis.
